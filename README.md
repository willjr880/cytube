This is a custom theme for CyTube edited to my personal liking with some functionality changes that others might find useful.

For more information, see the original at https://github.com/calzoneman/sync and consider merging my changes if suitable for you.

Functional Changes
* Popup style custom emotes
* Keep Public Channels listed even when the viewer count is 0

Theme changes
* Force a default theme (based on slate)
* Video on left and chat on right by default (similar looking to yt live chat)
* Fixed video and chat widths (scaled with viewport width)
* 'Currently Playing' Video title underneath video
* Viewer count moved to bottom right of video (twitch-like)
* User list as a dropdown
* Chat timestamps default to off
* Every chat message shows username first
* Chat message background change on hover disabled
* Remove Layout dropdown from nav bar
* Options section in nav bar: removed General, Playback and Script Access tabs (uses hardcoded defaults)
* General layout colourscheme changes

Thanks to m60 for his existing edits and the motivation to do this.
